# practice
This repository contains my personal web development practice projects, focusing on HTML, CSS and responsive Web Design.
It serves as a Sandbox for experimenting with layouts,UI components, and frontend coding techniques.

## Purose
The main goal of this repository is to:
- Practice Core Web technologies (HTML,CSS & JavaScript)
- Learn and implement responsive UI design
- Experiment with Flexbox, CSS grids, and UI layouts
- Build small components like headers, cards, and navigations bars.
